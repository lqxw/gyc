<h1>Shape of My Heart</h1>
He deals the cards as a meditation<br>
And those he plays never suspect<br>
He doesn't play for the money he wins<br>
He don't play for respect<br>
He deals the cards to find the answer<br>
The sacred geometry of chance<br>
The hidden law of a probable outcome<br>
The numbers lead a dance<br>
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
He may play the jack of diamonds<br>
He may lay the queen of spades<br>
He may conceal a king in his hand<br>
While the memory of it fades<br>
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
And if I told you that I loved you<br>
You'd maybe think there's something wrong<br>
I'm not a man of too many faces<br>
The mask I wear is one<br>
Those who speak know nothing<br>
And find out to their cost<br>
Like those who curse their luck in too many places<br>
And those who fear are lost<br>
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
