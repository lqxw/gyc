<h1>Shape of My Heart</h1>
Hmm, yeah, yeah<br>
Baby, please try to forgive me<br>
Stay here don't put out the glow<br>
Hold me now don't bother if every minute it makes me weaker<br>
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah<br>
<br>
Lookin' back on the things I've done<br>
I was tryin' to be someone<br>
I played my part, kept you in the dark<br>
Now let me show you the shape of my heart<br>
<br>
Sadness is beautiful loneliness that's tragical<br>
So help me I can't win this war, oh no<br>
Touch me now don't bother if every second it makes me weaker<br>
You can save me from the man I've become<br>
<br>
Lookin' back on the things I've done<br>
I was tryin' to be someone<br>
I played my part, kept you in the dark<br>
Now let me show you the shape of my heart<br>
<br>
I'm here with my confession<br>
Got nothing to hide no more<br>
I don't know where to start<br>
But to show you the shape of my heart<br>
<br>
I'm lookin' back on things I've done<br>
I never wanna play the same old part<br>
I'll keep you in the dark<br>
Now let me show you the shape of my heart<br>
<br>
Lookin' back on the things I've done<br>
I was tryin' to be someone<br>
I played my part, kept you in the dark<br>
Now let me show you the shape of my heart<br>
<br>
Lookin' back on the things I've done<br>
I was tryin' to be someone<br>
I played my part, kept you in the dark<br>
Now let me show you the shape of my heart<br>
<br>
Show you the shape of my heart<br>
